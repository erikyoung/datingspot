Dating Spot is the Ruby Blog Web App 2.0. 

Yes it has functionality for blogging and editing blogs, but there's more: you can also reccommend places to go on dates and to hang out with others. 

Inside this app, the use of the Google Map API is applied, Photo Uploading functionality, commenting, and user authentication.
